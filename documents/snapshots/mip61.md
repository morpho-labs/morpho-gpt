Title: MIP61 - Creation of a MORPHO Rewards Committee Multisig

This submission proposes to create a Rewards Committee Multisig responsible for handling MORPHO rewards as part of Morpho reward programs.

As written in the forum on 6 May 2024, discussion related to that: https://forum.morpho.org/t/mip61-creation-of-a-morpho-rewards-committee-multisig/591

Here was the discussion related to that:
- Context
The MORPHO token has been successfully used to bootstrap markets on Morpho Blue and formerly on Morpho Optimizers. To date, 4.5% of the total supply of MORPHO tokens has been distributed to users.
However, managing MORPHO rewards is a slow and cumbersome process, requiring frequent DAO votes and many operational tasks for the DAO multisig.
To reduce the operational burden, the association proposes creating a Rewards Committee Multisig responsible for handling MORPHO rewards as part of Morpho reward programs.

- Specification
The Multisig would be a 3/5 Safe contract managed by 5 members of the Morpho Association.
The Rewards Committee Multisig will be responsible for carrying out the reward decision approved by the DAO by vote. The DAO Multisig will ensure that they have sufficient MORPHO to ensure these operations.

- Next Steps
If the vote passes, the next steps will be followed to make this happen:
    1. Creation of the Multisig
    2. Whitelisting of this Multisig to transfer MORPHO tokens by the DAO

The proposal was voted on and accepted on 27 May 2024.
