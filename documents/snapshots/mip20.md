Abstract
On June 2023, a critical vulnerability with medium likelihood was disclosed by a bounty hunter via Immunefi. While the attack required huge amount of immobilized capital, the operator paused all Optimizers until a fix was crafted, audited, and applied. The event has been described in-depth in this report (https://morpho.mirror.xyz/QVPDZEgNZqQeBIw0Vr7KNsw-0J4RIws9FflWv6X96yM).
This post proposes to ratify the upgrade that occurred and was required to protect users’ funds.
